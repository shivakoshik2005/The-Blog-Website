Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed on your system:

  * *Git*

Setup and Installation

Follow these steps to set up the project locally.

1.  *Clone the Repository*
    Open your terminal and clone the project repository using Git.

    sh
    git clone <your-repository-url.git>
    cd blog-website
    

2.  *Create and Activate a Virtual Environment*
    It's highly recommended to use a virtual environment to manage project dependencies.

      * *On macOS/Linux:*
        sh
        python3 -m venv venv
        source venv/bin/activate
        
      * *On Windows:*
        sh
        python -m venv venv
        .\venv\Scripts\activate
        

    Your terminal prompt should now be prefixed with (venv), indicating the virtual environment is active.

3.  *Install Dependencies*
    Install all the required Python packages listed in the requirements.txt file.

    sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    

4.  *Apply Database Migrations*

    sh
    python manage.py migrate
    

5.  *Create a Superuser*
    You'll need a superuser account to access the Django admin panel. Follow the prompts to create one.

    sh
    python manage.py createsuperuser
    

6.  *Run the Development Server*
